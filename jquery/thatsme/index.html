    <!-- TASK:

        Write a page about yourself with three navigation points:

        - Does not need to be responsive
        - When the document is loaded, all your content is slowly faded in
        - Include a header, a content and a footer
        - The navigation is located in the header and consists of three links
          "About me", "My favourite city", "My favourite songs"
          whereas the default behaviour is prevented and replaced by your own click events instead
        - All click events for the links change your main content accordingly
            - how you implement it, is up to you
        - When clicking a navigation link, your content changes with a JQuery animation of your choice

        "About me" -> 1 or 2 paragraphs about yourself
        "My favourite city" -> 1 paragraph about your city, including a nice picture
        "My favourite songs" -> Embed 2 or 3 Songs from Youtube in your page
                                (Google how to do that)
